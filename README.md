Serverless api to get positive and negative traits about different topics.

The idea here was to test AWS Lambda, and learn about serverless concept while writing code with TDD strategy.

The code just serves data stored in `data/topics.json` file through an api.

You can try it by cloning the repository and installing the `serverless` npm package. An account in Amazon Web Services is required, as you will need to configure your serverless installation with your keys in order to be capable to deploy the code in AWS Lambda with `serverless deploy` command.
